# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists and Tuples

All programs, regardless of the language needs to handle data of some kind. Python has some of the
most robust data structures in all programming languages. Some of these data types are lists and tuples

Lists are mutable, comma separated sequence of objects, enclosed in square brackets, while tuples can be
considered an immutable list.
This directory contain programs that entertain the use of both tuples and strings to solve programming
challenges in the ALX-Software Engineering Program, project titled the same as this README file.
