# 0x02. Python - import & modules

Python modules are files containing python functions and statements. Modules enable programmers
to reuse the code if they need.
To add a python module to the current python program, we use the import keyword.
This directory contain solutions to programming challenges that require the use of import statement
and modules in Python. As everything else in this repository, they are part of the ALX-Software Engineering
program.
