Testing a function that puts two new lines after every ., ! and ? in text
==========================================================================
We first import the function
------------------------------
>>> text_indentation = __import__("5-text_indentation").text_indentation
>>>
Then, we first pass in nothing
------------------------------
>>> text_indentation()
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'
>>>
We can also pass in a bad type such as an integer
-------------------------------------------------
>>> text_indentation(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: text must be a string
>>>
In addition, we can also pass in a string without any of the three signs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>>> text_indentation("Ufitemungu 220007970")
Ufitemungu 220007970
>>>
We can pass in a very long test 
-------------------------------
>>> text_indentation("Hey there! What is your name? My name is Docine.")
Hey there!
What is your name?
My name is Docine.

>>>
